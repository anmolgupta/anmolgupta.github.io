I&rsquo;m a software engineer for about 10 years, primarily at startups. I thrive in fast paced environment where accountability and ownership are high.
Outside of work, I enjoy drawing and painting with my daughter(mostly silly things), reading books, and feeding my board game obsession.
What I do
My experience is majorly working with microservices, databases and building the systems behind products.
I love to dig deep into multiple technologies and infrastructure components to find the optimal balance of scale, cost, and operational overhead. My core expertise is in Node.js and TypeScript, backed by years of hands-on work with AWS and Kubernetes-giving me a strong grasp of both application code and the infrastructure that runs it.
