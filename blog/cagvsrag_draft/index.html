Now, this dragged me to an another use of cursor: Planning feature. where, I am mostly planning with cursor to develop a new feature. It was good but it always used to throw me suggestions on the current codebase that has been there where I was always left with the choices/patterns followed in the present code-base and I found a very little opportunity to explore more patterns outside of current code-base. While this was enough to get my task done, but it was still not enough to help me understand the trade-offs that I am making and future opporutnities to scale that task.\nDisclaimer: My experience is from the period of Feb 2025-Dec 2025. Since then, cursor might have changed a lot that I am not aware of and feel free to email me if you want to add on top of it.\nAround Sep 2025, I started using Claude Code since I was already using cursor outside of it’s major capabilities of throwing me suggestions as I write code. I started using Claude Code majorly towards planning my task. I saw the similar behvaiour as that of Cursor where Claude Code was suggesting me from the existing implementation of code base and from the existing patterns but it has really outperformed Cursor in the sense when it gives me patterns from the exiting code base and then I ask it to get me patterns out of the existing code base in the Plan mode where it certainly tries to help me throw the patterns outside of my current codebase and that was real use-case where I started using Claude code more often. since now I have the ability to look a feature implementation from 3 code patterns and I can choose which one suits my taste and the organizational taste which I feel empowered to justify my implementation with greater confidence to other developers and leads (ofcouse everything has a tradeoff, the one that I chose gives me a better thought process of counting on my options, not choosing the other trade-offs and choosing the tradeoff in the option that I have selected).\nat this point, I was sold to use claude code more often and got myself invested in creating custom commands, skills and custom development workflow for a project to get things flowing. one of the my best command even today is /research which I have made for myself which tells claude to search internet and find answers for me rather than giving me answers from the currnet codebase or current context.\nNow, since the project start expanding and expanding, ofcourse the benefits that I could reap out from claude code becomes less and less and honestly then I started looking on my options to expanding the Context window of Claude code. The only option that comes in mind for expanding context window is RAG but wait, isn’t cursor already not implementing RAG on your code base and then gives you answer from the RAG. Yes, it does. then, if you were not happy with Cursor then, why will you be happy with building custom RAG with Claude code. there, I started again investing in Cursor to see if it can provide me a better answer. Yes, it does since the base of the project has been straightened now and a practice has already been implemented to code Cursor became a real good tool to help me out.\nNow, if I see the above story from an eye lens of another developer, they will not like the practices that is been followed in the project since the trade-offs that I made was on the present conditions in hand: scale, team size and expertise, time to get a feature developement done and cost of developing a feature. These situations will not remain constant in the future and every situation will change and so the developer needs and developement needs change. The question that now comes to my mind while making use of AI in coding task is: is RAG useful in development or is CAG more powerful in development?\nComing to this strategy where situation will never be the same and developer will always needs to adapt to the situation around him while devleoping a feature which means a developer is always researching, always innovating for better ways to implement his developement work, I feel going with CAG is more powerful in development. Now, issues with CAG is ofcourse that you are limited to a Context window size of an LLM. but wait, isn’t that what’s industry’s limitation too was where a single large codebase becomes too much more to manage and deploy that there are more conflicts than measurable developement in the codebase and that’s where industry leaders starts re-organizing, split a singly codebase to microservices, so that a small context of knowledge can be broken among multiple people and devleopers become free to innovate and experiment at their own boundaries, right?\nComing to this realization, I think it’s the choice where do you want to put your effort now while leveraging AI agents in development workflows. Are you fine to deal with the overhead of network in having micro-service architecture while making smallest investment in leveraging AI with CAG or do you want to make more investment towards a RAG and keep a single large codebase which keeps your network overhead and minimal as possible.\n","wordCount":"1089","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-01-15T13:16:01-05:00","dateModified":"2026-01-15T13:16:01-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anmol Gupta"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://anmolgupta.github.io/blog/cagvsrag_draft/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Anmol Gupta","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://anmolgupta.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://anmolgupta.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Anmol Gupta (Alt + H)">Anmol Gupta</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
