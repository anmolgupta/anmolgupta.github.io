&lt;p&gt;Like many developers in early 2025, I jumped into Cursor. The auto-suggest feature was impressive in theory, but here&amp;rsquo;s the thing—it kept nudging me toward its suggestions on every single line. I found myself constantly fighting against the flow rather than going with it. So I turned off auto-suggest entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was that the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; choice? Who knows. But it worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With auto-suggest off, I started using Cursor more selectively—writing the structure myself and calling on it when I needed help with specific functions or integrating services. It made me more productive, though I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite measure by how much. (Sound familiar? We&amp;rsquo;re all trying to figure out how to quantify AI-assisted productivity.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I discovered Cursor&amp;rsquo;s planning feature. This was interesting—I could plan out features before diving into code. But I noticed something: it kept suggesting patterns from my existing codebase. Great for consistency, not so great for exploring new approaches. I rarely got to see what else was out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: My experience spans Feb 2025 to Dec 2025. Cursor has probably evolved since then. If you&amp;rsquo;ve had different experiences, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear about them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="discovering-claude-code"&gt;Discovering Claude Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around September 2025, I started experimenting with Claude Code. I was already using Cursor outside its main auto-suggest capability, so why not try something different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, the planning experience felt similar—suggestions based on existing code patterns. But then I found something that clicked for me: when I explicitly asked Claude Code to show me patterns &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; my current codebase during planning, it actually did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I had options. I could look at a feature implementation from two or three different angles, choose the one that fit both my taste and my team&amp;rsquo;s preferences, and this is the part I really valued—justify my choices with confidence. Every approach has trade-offs, but now I understood what I was trading and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got invested. I built custom commands, skills, and workflows. One of my favorites is a &lt;code&gt;/research&lt;/code&gt; command that tells Claude to search the internet for answers rather than defaulting to the current codebase or context. It changed how I approached problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hitting-the-context-ceiling"&gt;Hitting the Context Ceiling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where it gets interesting. As my project grew, the benefits I was getting from Claude Code started diminishing. The codebase was simply getting too large for the context window to handle effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started thinking about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). But wait—wasn&amp;rsquo;t that exactly what Cursor was doing all along? Searching my codebase and retrieving relevant context?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to Cursor. And you know what? It worked better this time. The project had matured. Patterns were established. Having RAG-style retrieval over a well-structured codebase actually made sense now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cag-vs-rag-its-not-about-picking-a-winner"&gt;CAG vs RAG: It&amp;rsquo;s Not About Picking a Winner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at this journey, another developer might look at my choices and disagree completely. And that&amp;rsquo;s okay. The trade-offs I made were based on my situation at that moment: the scale of the project, team size and expertise, time constraints, and cost considerations. None of those things stay constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So which is better: RAG or CAG (Context-Augmented Generation)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s the right question. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAG feels more powerful when you&amp;rsquo;re in exploration mode—researching, innovating, trying new approaches. Yes, you&amp;rsquo;re limited by context window size. But isn&amp;rsquo;t that constraint similar to what the industry already deals with? Large monolithic codebases become unmanageable, so we split them into microservices. Smaller contexts, distributed ownership, freedom to experiment within boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAG shines when you have an established codebase with clear patterns. It&amp;rsquo;s great for consistency and for working within existing structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="where-do-you-want-to-invest"&gt;Where Do You Want to Invest?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the real question is: where do you want to put your effort?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you okay with the network overhead of a microservice architecture while making a smaller investment in AI tooling with CAG? Or would you rather invest more heavily in RAG infrastructure to support a larger, unified codebase with minimal network complexity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no universal answer. Your mileage will vary. Your project will change. Your needs will evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the one thing I&amp;rsquo;m confident about: the situation will never stay the same, and the best approach is to stay adaptable rather than loyal to any single tool or strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your experience been? I&amp;rsquo;d genuinely like to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer for about 10 years, primarily at startups. I thrive in fast paced environment where accountability and ownership are high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of work, I enjoy drawing and painting with my daughter(mostly silly things), reading books, and feeding my board game obsession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-i-do"&gt;What I do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience is majorly working with microservices, databases and building the systems behind products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love to dig deep into multiple technologies and infrastructure components to find the optimal balance of scale, cost, and operational overhead. My core expertise is in Node.js and TypeScript, backed by years of hands-on work with AWS and Kubernetes-giving me a strong grasp of both application code and the infrastructure that runs it. Following are some of the works that I have done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.nuralogix.ai/"&gt;Nuralogix&lt;/a&gt;, I built multi-region infrastructure which enabled me to re-architect the application layer for scale, making sure that we all expand well while minimizing operational overhead and improving debugging, accessibility, and extensibility for development teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://goniyo.com/"&gt;Niyo&lt;/a&gt;, I led the core platform that powered the company&amp;rsquo;s first direct-to-consumer banking integrations with IDFC and Equitas. Beyond the initial launch, I focused on scaling the product and growing the team&amp;rsquo;s technical confidence to enable team to independently drive feature discussions and own implementation decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get in touch if you have an opinion on my posts. I enjoy hearing from people with similar interests. I am on &lt;a href="https://linkedin.com/in/anmolgupta91"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
